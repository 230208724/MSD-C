To make the C++ code executable, you need to compile it into an executable file. Here are the steps to compile and run the code:

Save the C++ code in a file with a .cpp extension, for example, main.cpp.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the main.cpp file.

Use a C++ compiler, such as g++, to compile the code. Run the following command:
(bash)g++ main.cpp -o program

This command will compile the code and generate an executable file named program.

Once the compilation is successful, you can run the executable by executing the following command:

For macOS/Linux:
(bash)./program
For Windows:
program.exe

Replace program with the desired name for your executable file if you provided a different name in step 3.

The program will then be executed, and you should see the paths of the collected SWC files printed on the console.
